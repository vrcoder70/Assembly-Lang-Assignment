# Assembly-Lang-Assignment

This repository contains a collection of assembly language programs and resources. Assembly language is a low-level programming language that is a fundamental part of computer science and provides a deeper understanding of computer architecture and operations.

## Programs

The "Programs" directory in this repository contains various assembly language programs that showcase different aspects of assembly programming. These programs can be used to learn, practice, and explore assembly language concepts. Some of the key programs included are:

- [Arithmetics Logical operations](https://github.com/vrcoder70/Assembly-Lang-Assignment/tree/main/Assembly-Language-main/Arithmetics%20Logical%20operations)
- [ASCII Arithemetics](https://github.com/vrcoder70/Assembly-Lang-Assignment/tree/main/Assembly-Language-main/ASCII%20Arithemetics)
- [BCD Arithmetics](https://github.com/vrcoder70/Assembly-Lang-Assignment/tree/main/Assembly-Language-main/BCD%20Arithmetics)
- [String Operation](https://github.com/vrcoder70/Assembly-Lang-Assignment/tree/main/Assembly-Language-main/String%20Operation)
- [Working with user inputs](https://github.com/vrcoder70/Assembly-Lang-Assignment/tree/main/Assembly-Language-main/Working%20with%20user%20inputs)

Feel free to explore, modify, and run these programs to enhance your understanding of assembly language.
